Configuring Development Environment
-----------------------------------
Import the project into your IDE of choice. If you're using IntelliJ, import `core`, `desktop`, `android`, and `html5`
as separate modules. If you're using Eclipse, each directory will need to be imported as a separate project. Specific
documentation detailing setting up libGDX with your development environment can be found on the project's
[wiki](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/TableOfContents).

The dependencies for each module can be found [here](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html).
